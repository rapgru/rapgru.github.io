Viridian Software is an indie game studio based in Dublin, Ireland. I feel very 
grateful for having had the chance of completing an Erasmus+ internship in this company. 
During my time in Ireland, I greatly improved my software engineering skills by working 
on a real project and made many pleasurable ever-lasting memories.
